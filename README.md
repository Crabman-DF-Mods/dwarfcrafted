# DwarfCrafted - v1.0.1 [47.05]

_NOT AN OFFICIAL MINECRAFT PRODUCT. NOT APPROVED BY OR ASSOCIATED WITH MOJANG._

This mod aims to translate the things unique to the world of [Minecraft][MC] (creatures, plants, ores etc) into the world and spirit of [Dwarf Fortress][Dwarf_Fortress]. This includes spinoffs in the Minecraft franchise, such as [Minecraft Dungeons (MCD)][MCD] and its DLC's, to a lesser extent [Minecraft Earth (MCE)][MCE] and [Minecraft Story Mode (MCSM)][MCSM], and whatever may come out in the future.

This mod will not add anything from Minecraft that exists in the real world (eg, animals), even if Vanilla DF doesn't have it; other mods should be used for real world stuff. The exception to this rule will be if it's strongly tied to a fantasy thing somehow; for example, if cows didn't already exist in DF, I would have added them for the sake of mooshrooms.

This mod was created with the help of the [Dwarf Fortress RAW language server extension][LS], which is currently in beta, but I still recommend it for anyone wanting to make Dwarf Fortress mods, either for the first time or as a veteran.
