creature_mc_golem

[OBJECT:CREATURE]

Note, there is no way to make these buildable by civs yet, and I refuse to cheat by
making them breedable (maybe DFhack to allow them to be created, but nothing else).
When Myth&Magic comes, it should be possible to have them properly be a part of the
villager/illager civs as magical constructs.
