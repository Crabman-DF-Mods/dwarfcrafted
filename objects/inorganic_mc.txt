	[USE_MATERIAL_TEMPLATE:STONE_TEMPLATE]
	[STATE_NAME_ADJ:ALL_SOLID:prismarine][DISPLAY_COLOR:6:7:0][TILE:'#']
	[ENVIRONMENT:SOIL_OCEAN:CLUSTER_ONE:1] very rare, not natural
	[MATERIAL_VALUE:8] to make up for rarity a bit
	[AQUIFER]
	[MELTING_POINT:12070]

	TODO should probably have a unique color, or be described as shifting

Netherrack is weird; very soft (like dirt), but has a consistency that requires
a pickaxe instead of a shovel (in order to harvest). Can be cooked in a furnace to
make a much harder bricklike material. It's got a lot of similarities to clay.
[INORGANIC:NETHERRACK]
	[USE_MATERIAL_TEMPLATE:SOIL_TEMPLATE]
	[STATE_NAME_ADJ:ALL_SOLID:netherrack][DISPLAY_COLOR:4:4:0][TILE:176]
	[STATE_COLOR:ALL_SOLID:BURNT_UMBER] bucaneer
	[MELTING_POINT:15050] magma-safe for sure, even with presumably hotter nether magma
	[BOILING_POINT:17000]
	IGNITE_POINT:NONE] have to do something here later so it can burn forever
	[SOLID_DENSITY:1210] copied from clay
	[MATERIAL_VALUE:10] to make up for extreme rarity since it's only found in procgen beasties

TODO inorganic materials
- netherite scrap (both ore and metal)
- soul sand/soil
- glowstone
- blackstone (maybe already has real-world counterpart?)
- nether quartz
- NATIVE_NETHER_GOLD ore is necessary I think; can't get gold ore in netherrack otherwise
- end stone
- redstone
